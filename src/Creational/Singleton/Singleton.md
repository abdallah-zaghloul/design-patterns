|     | - You can be sure that a class has only a single instance                          | - Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The pattern solves two problems at the same time |
|     | - You gain a global access point to that instance                                  | - can mask bad design if component of the program know too much about each other                 |
|     | - The singleton object is initialized only when itâ€™s requested for the first time. | - requires special treatment in a multi-threaded environment                                     |
