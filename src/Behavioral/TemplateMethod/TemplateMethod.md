## Template Method
Is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a
skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses
override the steps without changing the overall algorithm's
structure
The Template Method pattern is quite common in PHP
frameworks. 
The pattern simplifies the extension of a default
framework's behavior using the class inheritance
