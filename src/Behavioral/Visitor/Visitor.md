## Visitor
Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an
object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without
changing the classes of the elements on which it operates
In other words the visitor pattern allows you to separate
algorithms from the object Skeleton on which it performs.
At its core it allows for adding functions to classes
without modifying the classes themselves.

on the other languages ... it uses overloading with double dispatch
