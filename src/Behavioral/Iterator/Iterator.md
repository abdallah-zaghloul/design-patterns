## Iterator
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential
traversal through a complex data structure without exposing
its internal details.
In other words it's used to make an object iterable and to
make it appear like a collection of objects.
The pattern is very common in PHP code. Many frameworks
and libraries use it to provide a standard way for
traversing their collections.
