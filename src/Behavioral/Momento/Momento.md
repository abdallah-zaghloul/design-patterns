## Momento
is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore
the previous state of an object without revealing the details of
its implementation.
The memento pattern is implemented with three objects
Memento: An object that contains a concrete unique
snapshot of state of any object or resource
• Originator: - It is an object that contains the actual states
an external object is strictly specified type
• Caretaker: Controls the states' history.
