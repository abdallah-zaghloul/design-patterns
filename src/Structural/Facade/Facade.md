## Facade
Facade provides a simplified interface to a library, a
framework, or any other complex set of classes.
Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your
app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features,
but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.
Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited
but straightforward interface to a complex
Subsystem.
