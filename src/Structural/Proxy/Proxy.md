## Proxy
provides an object that
acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client
A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access
control, caching, etc.) and then passes the request to a
service object.
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you
perform something either before or after the
Request gets through to the original object
