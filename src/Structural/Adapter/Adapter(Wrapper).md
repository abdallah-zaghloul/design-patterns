# Adapter (Wrapper)
The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It
catches calls for one object and transforms them to format
and interface recognizable by the second object.
To allows classes to work together that normally could not
because of incompatible interfaces by providing its
interface to clients while using the original interface

- usually used with third party libraries
