Design Patterns :
general repeatable solution to common problems in software design ...
it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many situations

problems examples :
- create only one class instance
- create multiple instances of similar kind with loose coupling.
- abstract database actions from our logic

importance :
- speed up the development process by providing tested proven development paradigms
- making the overall system easier to understand and maintainable
- easy developer's communication when discussing system design
